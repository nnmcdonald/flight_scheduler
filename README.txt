This program schedules flights for an airport with n gates specified by the user. The airport is open from 0600-2300 
and flights are grounded for an hour after landing, and cannot land or take off while the airport is closed.
The program prompts the user to enter a number of gates, then reads in a flight schedule from FlightList.txt
then it schedules the daily flights for each gate diplaying the result. Then it outputs the flights that couldn't
be scheduled and why.
